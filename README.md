# Who?

This is a simple OpenColorIO configuration for intermediate to advanced imagers using Blender's Cycles raytracing engine.

# What?

This OpenColorIO configuration adds a closer-to-photorealistic view transform for your renders.  For imagers working with non-photorealistic rendering, it also will bring significant dynamic range and lighting capabilities to your work, as well as potentially open up correct transforms for rendering to HDR displays and other such forward-looking technology.  It is as close to a Magic Buttonâ„¢ you can get for an experienced imager.

# When?

This repository is ready to use immediately, with no compilation or special Blender application binaries required.

# Why?

The basic sRGB EOTF was never designed for rendering and should be avoided.  This configuration is a step towards providing imagers with a reliable View transform and a Look set useful for modern raytracing engine CGI, animation, and visual effects work with real-world cameras.

# How?

1. [Download the latest version of Filmic Blender](https://github.com/sobotka/filmic-blender/archive/master.zip).  Replace your current OpenColorIO configuration in Blender with this version.

2. The Blender OpenColorIO configuration directory is located in:

        BLENDER/bin/VERSIONNUMBER/datafiles/colormanagement

    Move the existing ````colormanagement```` directory to a backup location before placing the contents of
    this repository into a new ````colormanagement```` directory.

3. Optionally, instead of replacing the actual directory, use the envrionment variable to specify where this OCIO configuration lives:

        export OCIO=/path/to/where/the/filmic-blender/config.ocio

4. From within the Color Management panel, change the View to your desired contrast level and render.

Once you have Blender utilising the configuration, you are free to render away -- **you may discover that some of your materials were broken due to exceptionally low lighting levels, and may require reworking.**  General PBR advice holds true when using wider and more photographic illumination levels.

# Supported Displays

The current configuration supports:
 * Generic sRGB / REC.709 displays with 2.2 native power function
 * Display P3 displays with 2.2 native power function; examples include:
   * Apple MacBook Pros from 2016 on.
   * Apple iMac Pros.
   * Apple iMac from late 2015 on.
 
 Due to an unfortunate side effect of the way Blender has thus far integrated colour management, folks pushing pixels on Apple Display P3 devices will need to be careful when encoding images.  Loosely:
 * When viewing renders, use the Apple Display P3 setting.
 * When saving nonlinear display referred files such as JPEG, TIFF, etc., it is critical that the Display be set to the file encoding.  For example, for sRGB imagery, the View must be set to sRGB for the file to be properly encoded.  **If this is not done, the file will not be encoded properly.**  [The bug / todo can be found at the link provided](https://developer.blender.org/T58805).

# Additional Information and Technical Details

The basic kit of *weaponry* includes:

## View Transforms

A set of View transforms that include:

 1. ***sRGB EOTF***.  This is an accurate version of the sRGB transfer function.  This is identical to what imagers would use as the "Default" View transform in Blender proper.  Should be avoided at all costs for CGI work.  Useful in some edge cases.
 2. ***Non-Colour Data***.  This is a view useful for evaluating a data format.  Do not expect to see perceptual values however, as it is literally data dumped directly to the screen.  Use this transform on your buffer, via the *UV Image Viewer* Properties panel, if your buffer represents data and not colour information.  This will keep it out of the OpenColorIO transformation pipeline chain and leave it as data.
 3. ***Linear Raw***.  This is a colour managed linearized version of your data.  For all intents an purposes, will look identical to ***Non-Colour Data***, but applied to colour-based data such as an image.
 4. ***Filmic Log Encoding Base***.  This is the workhorse View for all of your rendering work.  Setting it in the View will result in a log encoded appearance, which will look exceptionally low contrast.  Use this if you want to adjust the image for grading using another tool such as Resolve, with no additional modifications.  Save to a high bit depth display referred format such as 16 bit TIFF.  This basic view is designed to be coupled with one of the contrast looks.

## Look Transforms

A set of Look transforms that include:

 1. ***Greyscale***.  This Look is based off of the ***Filmic Log Encoding Base*** and will deliver a weighted greyscale version of the image.  The weights used are for REC.709 RGB lights, which are the same lights specified in sRGB.
 2. Five contrast base looks for use with the ***Filmic Log Encoding Base***. All map middle grey 0.18 to 0.5 display referred. Each has a smooth roll off on the shoulder and toe. They include:
    i. ***Very High Contrast***
    ii. ***High Contrast***
    iii. ***Medium High Contrast***
    iv. ***Base Contrast*** (similar to the sRGB contrast range, with a smoother toe)
    v. ***Medium Low Contrast***
    vi. ***Low Contrast***
    vii. ***Very Low Contrast***
 3. ***False Colour***.  This Look is an extremely useful tool for evaluating your image in terms of the dynamic range and latitude.  It is a colour-coded "heat map" of your image values, according to the following codes:

    | Value | Colour | Scene Referred Value |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | Low Clip | Black | Scene Referred Linear value below 0.0001762728758. |
    | -10 EV | Purple | Scene Referred Linear value 0.0001762728758. |
    | -7 EV | Blue | Scene Referred Linear value 0.001404109349. |
    | -4 EV | Cyan | Scene Linear value 0.01124714399. |
    | -2 EV | Green | Scene Referred Linear value 0.04456791864. |
    | 0 EV| Grey | Scene Referred Linear value 0.18009142. |
    | +2 EV | Green | Scene Referred Linear value 0.7196344767. |
    | +4 EV | Yellow | Scene Referred Linear value 2.883658483. |
    | +5.5 EV | Red | Scene Referred Linear value 8.150007644. |
    | High Clip | White | Scene Referred Linear value above 16.29174024. |

# Grading Your Work

Given that images generated under Cycles are scene referred, many nodes in Blender, being broken, will not work properly.  This may have been hidden if one used a range that perfectly mapped to the display-referred domain such as the sRGB EOTF, however, using a proper View transform exacerbates this brokenness.

There are a good number of nodes that work absolutely fine.  For grading, it is highly encouraged to use the ASC CDL node, as it operates on scene-referred imagery perfectly well.  It is in the ***Color -> Color Balance*** node.  Do **not** use the ***Lift, Gamma, Gain*** default as it is strictly a display-referred formula and will break on scene-referred imagery.  Instead, change the drop-down selection to ***ASC CDL*** and use the *Slope*, *Offset*, and *Power* controls to perform grading.

Almost all of the Adobe PDF specification blend modes in the ***Mix*** node are also display-referred and are broken for Cycles rendering.  This includes, but is not limited to, Overlay, Screen, and other such modes.

# Viewing in Other Applications

If you wish to tag Filmic still images for viewers that are properly colour-managed, an ICC profile that uses REC.709 primaries, white point, and specifies a 2.2 power function is appropriate.  [Elle Stone has such a profile located in her GitHub](https://github.com/ellelstone/elles_icc_profiles/blob/master/profiles/sRGB-elle-V2-g22.icc).  The canonized sRGB ICC profile is not a match; simply assign the profile to your generated image, but do not convert.
